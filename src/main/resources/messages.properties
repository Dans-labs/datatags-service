dans.v1.home.contentText=<p>Since May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is into force. This EU-legislation empowers citizens in taking control over their privacy. It is within this framework that DANS (Data Archiving and Networked Services)  has developed Datatags, which is specifically designed to help researchers comply to this law. It is based on the work of Sweeney, Crosas & Bar-Sinai and their automated Datatags system for repositories.</p> \
<p>This questionnaire consists of six questions, and will take up to half an hour of your time depending on your dataset. Throughout the questionnaire, you will find various informative websites with in-depth explanation of the GDPR and related concepts.</p> \
<p>A fast, simple, and little-text-questionnnaire is not suitable for something as important as privacy protection. We ask you to take time to answer this questionnaire, and think about its effect on your dataset. Our ultimate goal with this instrument is to create awareness and accountability, not tick-box-compliance.</p> \
<p>We continuously improve our services, so your feedback and questions are very much appreciated; please do not hesitate to contact Frans Huigen via frans.huigen@dans.knaw.nl.</p>

dans.v1.s2-personal-info.subtitle=DANS Datatags question 1 of 6 - Personal information
dans.v1.s2-personal-info.contentText=<p>Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. This identification can be done directly or indirectly through an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.</p> \
<p>You can find additional deepening information on this concept and relating cases on this website. It is important to determine whether or not your dataset contains personal data: if it would not, it would be out of scope of the GDPR.</p>

dans.v1.s3-disclaimer.contentText=<p>You indicated that your dataset contains personal information. Any unlawful processing of the personal information would pose an unacceptable risk for you, DANS, and the data subjects. DANS would like to make the following points clear:</p> \
<ol> \
<li>The GDPR distinguishes certain roles in relation to the processing of personal data. Please find detailed information about that on this website.  In essence, since you determine the purpose of the processing of the dataset, you are the controller. DANS is the processor, since we process the data on your behalf.</li> \
<li>As the controller of the dataset, you are fully aware of its contents and can thus answer our questions truthfully.</li> \
<li>Any end-result of this questionnaire is not to be considered legally binding; it serves as advice for awareness-building and accountability. Should you feel uncertain about the questions or the outcome, always contact privacy experts, data stewards, and/or the Data Protection Officer of your institution.</li> \

dans.v1.s4-anonymised-data.contentText=<p>Remember that the GDPR defines personal data as information referring to any identifiable or identified natural person. You might have decided to anonymise your dataset; you have removed any information that identifies an individual. There are certain guidelines and considerations for anonymisation. Please take note of this website, where the Finnish Social Science Data Archive explains the concepts thoroughly.</p> \
<p>DANS is interested in this, although the dataset would fall out of scope of the GDPR.</p>

dans.v1.s5-consent.subtitle=DANS Datatags question 3 of 6 - Consent
dans.v1.s5-consent.contentText=<p>Now that we have determined the content of your dataset in general, we would like to know whether or not you have obtained consent for the processing of your dataset. Consent is an important issue in the GDPR, since it has been installed to empower the EU citizens in obtaining control over their privacy.</p> \
<p>The essence of the concept of consent for the processing of personal data is that it has to be informed, freely given, specific, unambiguous, and affirmative. You can find extensive information and additional links via this website. This question includes cases where the parentally responsible gave consent, in case the data subject was below the age of 16.</p>

<p>You have indicated that you have not obtained consent for the processing of the dataset. In the case that consent for processing has not been obtained, DANS does not accept the risk, despite the GDPR providing for derogations of this rule, for example when consent would not be your legal base for processing. Please consider articles 83 and 84, concerning administrative fines and penalties respectively.</p> \

dans.v1.s6-purpose-definition.contentText=<p>As mentioned earlier, you as the controller of the dataset have defined the purposes of the processing. In the case of this questionnaire, and that of your dataset, it will most likely be the further use of research data and publication of your work.</p> \
<p>The GDPR provides a framework for personal information that is being processed within the scientific context (such for example health data). The article in the GDPR concerning this topic is Article 89, you can find it here. For a deeper dive into this topic, consider this blogpost.</p> \
<p>We need to be aware of the purpose you have collected your data for. It is easy to assume you have for scientific purposes, but we need to be certain. This is because of the controller-processor relationship, for the purpose of accountability and awareness.</p>

<p>You have indicated that your non-anonymised personal data, for the processing of which you have obtained consent. However, it is unclear for which purpose process this data. That is a risk DANS is not willing to accept, since article 4 and article 7 explain that consent has to be, among other things, specific. So although you have obtained consent, following the GDPR rules, the processing purpose is unclear. That is an ambiguity you would have to discuss with your institutes data steward or privacy experts. Please consider articles 83 and 84, concerning administrative fines and penalties respectively.</p>\

dans.v1.s7-appropriate-safeguards.title=DANS Datatags prototype 2
dans.v1.s7-appropriate-safeguards.subtitle=DANS Datatags question 5 of 6 - Appropriate safeguards
dans.v1.s7-appropriate-safeguards.contentText=<p>We have defined the content of your dataset and the conditions of its creation (consent and purpose). Inasmuch as you (the controller) are responsible for determining the purpose of the processing, you have to ensure that so-called appropriate technical and organisational measures are in place to ensure lawful processing. These measures are mentioned in recital 78.</p>\
<p>In this context it can be difficult to determine who is responsible for which measures. For example: you as the depositing researcher are not responsible for security measures (like encryption, multi-factor authentication, etc.) DANS has implemented to protect the stored data.For more information concerning this topic, follow this link for more examples and in-depth explanation of technical and organisational measures.</p>\
<p>A concrete example is of a technical measure you can take on your own dataset is pseudonymisation, you replace certain identifiers with other data.</p>\
<p>The reason DANS wants to know this information, is to determine whether or not measures have been taken and which ones we would have to take.</p>

<p>You have indicated that, for your dataset containing non-anonymised personal data, you have obtained consent and you have a clear purpose. However, indicating that you have not at least taken the measure of pseudonymisation, your personal data would remain unprotected or at least at risk. DANS cannot be the only one responsible for the protection of the data, that is a burden we - controller and processor - both have to carry. Please consider articles 83 and 84 concerning administrative fines and penalties respectively.</p>\
